                Fronted by Vocalist and Lead Guitarist Bécy Füzéri (Bex), Matt Morris on Rhythm Guitar, 
                Lajos Borsi Bass/Vocals and Luke Ellwood on Drums. They describe their sound as an 
                explosive combination of thrash and groove metal with their own artistic flair.

                Though both Hungarian Bex and Lajos didn't know each other before migrating to England from Hungary; they met through 
                work years later. After finding similar motives they formed what would eventually become 'GSD'. Luke joined the band 
                after seeing an advertisement online. Forming in 2014 the band immediately started writing a number of songs which lead 
                to the self-production and self-release of their EP Creator of Sodom in late 2015. The EP was well received and was also 
                highlighted in Terrorizer #274 with the title track featured on the magazines accompanied CD FEAR CANDY. After playing numerous
                shows around the Manchester area and becoming a popular band within the underground scene in the city, they began writing new 
                material for a full length album. During the writing process the bands' sound had evolved, sparking a change within the line 
                up; in 2017 Bex became Frontman/Lead Guitarist and Matt joined as Rhythm Guitarist.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since then, they have released their first full length album 'Dark Fields' in July 2019; which received great praise locally 
                and globally. They are currently in the process of writing and recording for the next as of yet untitled album.</p>
